An Overview to the Back Propagation Computation.

This whitepaper provides a clear understanding of how the working of an artificial neurons
mathematically. The artificial neurons with three layers (input - hidden - output) of 
neurons series interconnected among the layers is picked to present in the material of 
this paper.The foremost back-propagation computation is used to streamline all the neurons
stimuli at the full advantages of reduced error-factor in every completion of learning cycle done to 
the neural network. The learning rates factor in this material is chosen to be among 
0.15 and 0.20 but it is freely can be variably set to any value between 0.00 and 1.00 
to met our own needs and suits.
